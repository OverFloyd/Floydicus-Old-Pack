# Floydicus-Old-Pack

Hello people, last year I started a private resource pack which had the goal of reproducing Minecraft Beta as much as possible. Using classic textures, custom models, blockstates and everything in the between.

After working on it for nearly a year with feedback from several people, I've decided to make this public to everyone to enjoy.

The resource pack is being developed for both versions 1.15.X and 1.12.2 (still in development), an older version for 1.12.2.
The packs for each version are under <code>src/</code>
